Adding Labels
*************

Labels can be added to a map to show any information about an object. Any
vector layer can have labels associated with it. These labels rely on the
attribute data of a layer for their content.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   attribute_data
   label_tool





- changing font options etc. (global)
- get rid of points for layer, use "over point", other style options
- using STREETS layer: multipart objects - label each part setting label attrs
  from field (intermediate + advanced) - may require that we modify the data to
  put font sizes (e.g.) as an attribute
