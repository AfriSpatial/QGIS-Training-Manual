|L2| Colors
===============================================================================

**Description:**  Using the random palette automatically assigned when loading
the layers, your current map is probably not easy to read. It would be
preferable to assign your own choice of colors and symbols.

**Goal:** To be able to change a layer's basic color.

|basic| |L3| Exercise: Changing colors
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To change a layer's symbology, open its :guilabel:`Layer Properties`. This is
done by right-clicking on the layer in the Layers list, and then selecting the
menu item :guilabel:`Properties` in the menu that appears. Let's begin by
changing the color of the :guilabel:`urban` layer.

.. note:: You can also access a layer's properties by double-clicking on the
   layer in the Layers list.

In the :guilabel:`Properties` window, select the :guilabel:`Style` tab at the
extreme left:

Click the :guilabel:`Change` button next to the :guilabel:`Color` label
(outlined in orange above).  A standard color dialog will appear:

Choose a gray color and click :guilabel:`OK`. Click :guilabel:`OK` again in the
:guilabel:`Layer Properties` window, and you will see the color change being
applied to the layer.

Change the :guilabel:`rural` layer to a new color that you associate with rural
farming areas.
