|L1| Symbology
*******************************************************************************

The symbology of a layer is its visual appearance on the map.
The basic strength of GIS over other ways of representing data with spatial
aspects is that with GIS, you have a dynamic visual representation of the data
you're working with.

Therefore, the visual appearance of the map (which depends on the symbology of
the individual layers) is very important. The end user of the maps you produce
will need to be able to easily see what the map represents. Equally as
important, you need to be able to explore the data as you're working with it,
and good symbology helps a lot.

In other words, having proper symbology is not a luxury or just nice to have.
In fact, it's essential for you to use a GIS properly and produce maps and
information that people will be able to use.

**The goal for this module:** To be able to create any symbology you want for
any vector layer.
