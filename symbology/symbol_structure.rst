|L2| Symbol Structure
===============================================================================

**Description:** This is good stuff so far, but there's more to a layer's
symbology than just its color. Next we want to change the color of the farms
(the :guilabel:`rural` layer), but we also want to eliminate the lines between
the different farms so as to make the map less visually cluttered.

**Goal:** To be able to change the structure of a symbol.

|basic| |L3| Exercise: Changing symbol structure
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, open the :guilabel:`Layer Properties` window for the :guilabel:`rural`
layer. Under the :guilabel:`Style` tab, you will see the same kind of dialog as
before. This time, however, you're doing more than just quickly changing the
color. So click on the :guilabel:`Change...` button below the color display,
outlined in the image below:

.. image:: ../_static/symbology/006-diagram.png

This dialog will appear:

.. image:: ../_static/symbology/007.png

First, change the color inside the polygons in the layer by clicking the button
next to the :guilabel:`Color` label (if you haven't done so already during the
previous lesson). In the dialog that appears, choose a new color (that seems to
suit a farm) and click :guilabel:`OK`, but only once.

Next, we want to get rid of the lines between all the farms. To do this, click
on the :guilabel:`Border style` dropdown. At the moment, it should be showing a
short line and the words :guilabel:`Solid Line`. Change this to :guilabel:`No
Pen`. Then click :guilabel:`OK`, and then :guilabel:`OK` again. Now the
:guilabel:`rural` layer should not have any lines!

|basic| |L3| Challenge
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First change the :guilabel:`urban` layer's symbology so that it is orange and
without outlines. (Orange is a color often used to denote human habitation.)

Next, change the :guilabel:`rural` layer again so that it has dotted outlines
which are just a bit darker than the fill color for that layer.
