Verify that the colors are changing as you expect them to change. It is enough
to change only the :guilabel:`rural` layer for now. An example is below, but
may look different depending on the color you chose.

.. note:: If you want to work on only one layer at a time and don't want the
   other layers to distract you, you can hide a layer by clicking in the check
   box next to its name in the Layers list. If the box is blank, then the layer
   is hidden.

Seen alone, your rural layer should look more or less like this:

.. image:: ../_static/symbology/020.png

If you are a Beginner-level user, you may stop here. Use the method above to
change the colors and styles for all the remaining layers. Try using natural
colors for the objects. For example, a road should not be red or blue, but can
be gray or black.

Also feel free to experiment with different :guilabel:`Fill Style` and
:guilabel:`Border Style` settings.

Customize your layers as you like, but remember that it has to be easy to tell
different layers apart on the map.

Here's an example:

.. image:: ../_static/symbology/013.png

.. _symbology-levels-1:

To make the required symbol, you need at least three symbol layers:

.. image:: ../_static/symbology/021.png

The lowest symbol layer is a broad, solid yellow line. On top of it there is a slightly thinner solid dark gray or black line. The symbol layer on top is a thin white dashed line.

If your symbol layers resemble the above but you're not getting the result you want, check that your symbol levels look something like this:

.. image:: ../_static/symbology/022.png

Now your symbol should look like this:

.. image:: ../_static/symbology/023.png

Which, on the map, gives you this kind of effect:

.. image:: ../_static/symbology/024.png
