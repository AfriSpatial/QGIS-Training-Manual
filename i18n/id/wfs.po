msgid "A Web Feature Service returns the layer itself, not just a map rendered from it. This gives you direct access to the data, meaning that you can change ts symbology and run analysis functions on it. However, this is at the cost of much more data being transmitted. This will be especially obvious if the layers you're loading have complicated shapes, a lot of attributes, or many features; or even if you're just loading a lot of layers. WFS layers typically take a very long time to load because of this."
