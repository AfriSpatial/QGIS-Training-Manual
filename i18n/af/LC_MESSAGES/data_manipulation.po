"Raster data is quite different from vector data. Vector data has discrete "
"features constructed out of vertices, and perhaps connected with lines and/"
"or areas. Raster data, however, is like any image. Although it may portray "
"various properties of objects in the real world, these objects don't exist "
"as separate objects; rather, they are represented using pixels of various "
"different color values."
