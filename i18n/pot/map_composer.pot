Remember that the emphasis for evaluating the appearance of maps will always be *ease of use*. The nicer the map is to look at and the easier it is to understand at a glance, the better."

msgid "Now that you've got a map, you need to be able to print it or to export it to a document. The reason is, a GIS map file is not an image! Rather, it saves the state of the GIS program, with references to all the layers, their labels, colors, etc. So for someone who doesn't have the data or the same GIS program (such as QGIS), the map file will be useless. Luckily, QGIS can export its map file to a format that anyone's computer can read, as well as printing out the map if you have a printer connected. Both exporting and printing is handled via the Map Composer."
