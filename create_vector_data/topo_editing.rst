|LS| Feature Topology
===============================================================================

Topology is a useful aspect of vector data layers, because it minimizes errors
such as overlap or gaps. If two features share a border, and you edit the
border using topology, then you won't need to edit first one feature, then
another, and carefully line up the borders so that they match. Instead, you can
edit their shared border and both features will change at the same time.

**The goal for this lesson:** To understand topology using an example.
