|L2| Adding your first layer
===============================================================================

**Goal:** To get started with an example map.

**Description:** We will start the application, and create a basic map to use
for examples and exercises.

Before starting this exercise, QGIS should be installed on your computer.
Launch QGIS from its desktop shortcut, menu item, etc., depending on how you
configured its installation.

.. note:: The screenshots for this course were taken in QGIS 1.8 running on
   Ubuntu Linux. Depending on your setup, the screens you encounter may well
   appear somewhat different. However, all the same buttons will still be
   available, and the instructions will work on any OS and recent QGIS
   version.

Let's get started right away! To begin, you will prepare the basis of the map
that will be the basis for examples and further exercises for this course.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With QGIS open, look for the following button:

.. image:: ../_static/interface/002.png

Click on it to open the following dialog:

.. image:: ../_static/interface/003.png

Now click on the :guilabel:`Browse` button and navigate to the file
:kbd:`LINE_PATH`. With this file selected, click :guilabel:`Open`. You will see
the original dialog, but with the file path filled in. Click :guilabel:`Open`
here as well. The data you specified will now load.

Congratulations! You now have a basic map. Now would be a good time to save
your work. Click on the :guilabel:`Save As` button:

.. image:: ../_static/interface/004.png

Save the map under :kbd:`SAVE_PATH`, using your surname and initials as the
file name.
