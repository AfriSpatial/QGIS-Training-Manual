An Overview of the Interface
============================

**Goal:** To understand the basics of the QGIS user interface.

**Description:** We will explore the QGIS user interface so that you are
familiar with the menus, toolbars, map canvas and layers list that compose the
application.

The Basics 
----------

Now you're already familiar with the function of the :guilabel:`Add Vector
Layer` button, but what about all the others? How does this interface work?
Before we go on with the more involved stuff, let's first take a good look at
the general layout of the QGIS interface.

.. image:: ../_static/interface/001-diagram.png

The elements identified in the figure above are:

#. Layers list
#. Toolbars
#. Map canvas
#. Status bar

.. Don't reorder these list items! They refer to elements as numbered on an
   image.

The Layers List
...............

In the Layers list, you can see a list, at any time, of all the layers
available to you.

.. note:: A vector layer is a dataset, usually of a specific kind of object,
   such as roads, trees, etc. A vector layer can consist of either points,
   lines or polygons.

Expanding collapsed items (by clicking the arrow or plus symbol beside them)
will provide you with more information on the layer's current appearance.

Right-clicking on a layer will give you a menu with lots of extra options. You
will be using some of them before long, so take a look around!

Some versions of QGIS have a separate :guilabel:`Control rendering order`
checkbox just underneath the Layers list. Don't worry if you can't see it. It
will be addressed later.

Toolbars
........

Your most oft-used sets of tools can be turned into toolbars for easy access.
For example, the File toolbar allows you to save, load, print, and start a new
project. You can easily customize the interface to see only the tools you use
most often, adding or removing toolbars as necessary via the
:menuselection:`View --> Toolbars` menu.

Even if they are not vsible in as a toolbar, all of your tools will remain
accessible via the menus. For example, if you remove the :guilabel:`File`
toolbar (which contains the :guilabel:`Save` button), you can still save your
map by clicking on the :guilabel:`File` menu and then clicking on
:guilabel:`Save`.

The Map Canvas
..............

This is where the map itself is displayed.

The Status Bar
..............

Shows you information about the current map. Also allows you to adjust the map
scale and see the mouse cursor's coordinates on the map.

Exercises
---------

Try to identify the four elements listed above on your own screen, without
referring to the diagram above. See if you can identify their names and
functions. You will become more familiar with these elements as you use them in
the coming days.

Understanding the controls
..........................

Try to find each of these tools on your screen. What is their purpose?

#. .. image:: ../_static/interface/004.png
#. .. image:: ../_static/interface/005.png
#. .. image:: ../_static/interface/006.png
#. .. image:: ../_static/interface/007.png
#. .. image:: ../_static/interface/008.png
