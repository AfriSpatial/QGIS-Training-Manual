Shapefiles
==========

The Shapefile is a specific file format that allows you to store GIS data in an
associated group of files. Each layer consists of several files with the same
name, but different file types. Shapefiles are basic to send back and forth, and
most GIS software can read them.

Exercise: Loading vector data from shapefiles
---------------------------------------------

Refer back to the introductory exercise in the previous section for
instructions on how to add vector layers. Load the "places" dataset into your
map following the same method.

Check your results
..................

There should be two layers on your map: :guilabel:`places` and
:guilabel:`streets`.
